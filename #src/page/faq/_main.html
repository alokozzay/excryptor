            <div class="main__spoiler-about_text">
                The execution time of exchange usually varies from 5 to 30 minutes, depending on how quickly the transaction will be confirmed by the network and the new block will be formed in the blockchain network. Different coins require different confirmation times, and if some coin needs more confirmations, we notify the user of possible delays before they send us the coins. Once the coins arrive to our wallet, the exchange itself usually takes just a few minutes. In case of large volumes (more than 1 btc), the processing time may be a little longer.

            <div class="main__spoiler-about_text">
                Once you have decided what cryptocurrency you want to receive as a result of the exchange, you must have a place where it can be stored. There are official wallets for each coin, or multi-currency wallet applications. Each currency requires its own wallet address - a unique valid identifier that serves as a virtual location where the cryptocurrency can be sent. For example: 0x7fd44ba08d7ee76da0aff7cmj5f07125ac10caa5.

            <div class="main__spoiler-about_text">
                To get your own cryptocurrency address we recommend visiting the site of the currency you are going to buy. Usually creators of the coin develop official wallet for this, or recommends trusted one. We highly recommend to use only trusted services in order to avoid losing your funds.

            <div class="main__spoiler-about_text">
                The destination address is a unique wallet address to which ExCryptor.io sends the cryptocurrency after the exchange of coins. This wallet address must be valid for the currency you want to get. For example, exchanging ETC to XRP requires recipient address to be the address of the XRP coin.

            <div class="main__spoiler-about_text">
                After transaction is included in block, it cannot be recalled or changed by anyone, this is one of main features of blockchain. So please check carefully the data you entered before you make the exchange.

            <div class="main__spoiler-about_text">
                Each new transaction made by users in the blockchain has its own unique ID code that is assigned to the operation and will be stored in all subsequent new blocks. Using this ID (see also 'TX id') you can view the details of this transfer in a network and to authenticate transactions.

            <div class="main__spoiler-about_title"><span class="main__spoiler-about_number">/12</span>When does my exchange have a fixed rate?</div>
            <div class="main__spoiler-about_text">
                A fixed rate exchange allows to perform an exchange with the exact rate which is displayed to the client in the moment of a exchange creation. When the transaction is created, we fix the exchange rate to protect you from price fluctuations. Fixation remains if the funds arrive within 30 minutes after the transaction is created.

            <div class="main__spoiler-about_text">
                Processing your order takes time. During the transaction, you need to consider the variability of the exchange rate. It is necessary to understand, that the final conversion amount which will be transferred to you, is equivalent to the current exchange rate at the time of the exchange, which may differ from the initially stated, both upwards and downwards.

            <div class="main__spoiler-about_text">
                There are no upper limits for cryptocurrency exchanges on ExCryptor. But in order to transfer coins from one address to another, blockchain requires to pay so called Miner Fee, so ExCryptor.io has a minimal transaction volume to cover it.

            <div class="main__spoiler-about_text">
                In the exchange of some currencies we may ask you to not only send coins using provided address, but also specify an additional ID. The Additional ID is used by some currencies for transaction processing and identifying the transaction (Payment ID for Monero, Destination Tag for Ripple, Memo for Steem and Stellar, and Message for XEM). When ExCryptor provide you with additional ID, it is very important to send coins using this ID, otherwise funds may be lost. Please be careful!
